# Laminas Project Maintainers

We aim to have 2+ maintainers per repository. Maintainers have GitHub maintainer
rights to the repository(ies) they maintain, which means the ability to push
code to the repository, manage issues and pull requests, and manipulate selected
repository settings.

To become a maintainer, you must first have another maintainer or a TSC member
nominate you to the TSC. Nominations are done by submitting an issue to this
repository with a title prefix of `[MAINTAINER][NOMINATION]`. Maintainers are
approved by a majority vote of the TSC, which will be held no later than 1 week
following the nomination.

Current maintainers are found on the Teams page of each organization, on a team
matching the repository name:

- [Laminas organization teams](https://github.com/orgs/laminas/teams)
- [Laminas API Tools organization teams](https://github.com/orgs/laminas-api-tools/teams)
- [Mezzio organization teams](https://github.com/orgs/mezzio/teams)
