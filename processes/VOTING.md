# Technical Steering Committee Voting Process

While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community, many decisions
will require a vote in order to move forward:approval of new repositories
or subprojects, approval of archival/abandonment of repositories or subprojects,
approval of new maintainers, selection of Project Lead, etc.

Voting will happen either within a meeting, or via online vote.

Meetings will happen on the **{to be determined day of the month}**. An agenda
will be provided as an issue on the issue tracker of this repository, with the
ability for anybody to request an item be added, modified, or removed.

Quorum for a meeting requires at least 2/3 of all voting TSC members present. If
quorum is not met, the meeting may continue, but no votes or decisions may be
made.

A vote may be called during a meeting. Such votes pass only if a 2/3 majority of
all TSC members, not just those in attendance, approve.

A vote may also be initiated via **{a to be determined method}**. In such cases,
as with meeting votes, a 2/3 majority of all voting members is required for
approval.

## Decisions requiring a vote

The following list is non-exhaustive.
